Set you PATH with

export PATH=/usr/autotools/devel/bin:$PATH

the default "stable" autotools provided are not recent enough
and you will get problems if you have to run autoconf/autoheader/automake
or "autogen.sh"

You need to install the hdf libraries - you can download a pre-compiled
version from:
