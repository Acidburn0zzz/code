Attributes that are Arrays
==========================

Make the new NAPI methods ("attra") work in test.

Of the new NAPI methods ("attra") make work in any backend what ever is possible and only give an error for impossible things.
Reflect that in tests.

Make the old API fail (report an error) for attribute arrays, because reading half of them is wrong
Only exception might be 1D string attribute arrays that could be sensibly comma concatenated.
Writing 1D number arrays is in principle possible through the existing API but will break existing code on reading, so NO to that.
