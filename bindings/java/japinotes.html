<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://lns00.psi.ch/Nexus">NeXus</a> is a proposal for a
common file format for neutron and X-ray scattering. NeXus uses <a 
 href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">HDF</a> as its physical file format.
At the last <a href="http://nobugs.dl.ac.uk">NOBUGS</a> conference a strong 
 need for a Java-API to NeXus files was expressed. 
Version 1.0 of this Java API has now (October 2000) become
 available. As recoding the HDF library in Java was no option the Java
 API for NeXus (jnexus) was implemented through the Java Native
 Methods Interface (JNI). This has the consequence that the Java API
 for NeXus cannot be used in applets as the security restrictions for
 applets prohibit downloading of shared libraries   and local file
 access. Applets can use a NeXus Data Server in order to access NeXus
 files in readonly mode.  
</p>

<h2><a name="ack">Acknowledgement</a></h2>
<p>
This implementation uses classes and native methods from NCSA's Java
HDF Interface project. Basically all conversions from native types to
Java types is done through code from the NCSA HDF group. Without this
code the implementation of this API would have taken much longer. See <a 
 href="COPYING.NCSA">NCSA's copyright</a> for more information.     
</p>
<h2><a name="install">Installation</a></h2>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
For the binary distribution only a JDK1.1 compatible Java runtime is
required. Suitable runtime environments for Solaris, Linux and
Windows32 can be downloaded from <a
href="http://www.javasoft.com">Sun's Java</a> homepage. This website
also holds pointers to Java runtime systems for other
platforms. Jnexus has not been tested with Java 2 but should work with
it.  
</p>
<p>
In order to compile the Java API for NeXus the following components
are required:
<ul>
<li>A Java Development Kit 1.1 or better. For downloads see above.
<li>A C compiler for your platform.
<li>The HDF libraries version 4.1r3 or better. Can be downloaded from <a
href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA's HDF</a> homepage.
<li>A complete copy of the latest 
 <a href="http://sutekh.nd.rl.ac.uk/NAPI"> NAPI sources</a> (including jnexus
sources).
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Installation under Windows32 (Windows NT, Windows 95, 98, ME)</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the HDF DLL's (*413m.dll) and the file jnexus.dll to a
directory in your path. For instance C:\Windows\system32. 
<li>Copy the jnexus.jar to the place where you usually keep library
jar files. 
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Installation under Unix</h3>
<p>
Two files are needed: the jnexus.so shared library and the jnexus.jar
file holding the required Java class. Copy them wherever you like and
see below for instructions how to run programs using jnexus.
</p>

<h2><a name="#run">Running Programs with the NeXus API for Java</a></h2>
<p>
In order to successfully run a program with jnexus the Java runtime
systems needs to locate two items:
<ul>
<li>The shared library implementing the native methods.
<li>The nexus.jar file in order to find the Java classes.
</ul> 
</p>
<h3>Locating the shared library</h3>
<p>
Of course the method for locating a shared library differ between
systems. Under Windows32 systems the best method is to copy the
jnexus.dll and the HDF-libarary DLL's into a directory in your
path. The HDF DLL's have to go there anyway.
</p>
<p>
On a unix system the problem can be solved in three different ways:
<ul>
<li>Make your system administrator copy the jnexus.so file into the
systems default shared library directory (usually /usr/sbin).
<li>Put the jnexus.so file wherever you see fit and set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to the directory of your 
choice.
<li>Specify the full pathname of the jnexus shared library on the
java command line with the
-Dneutron.nexus.JNEXUSLIB=full-path-2-shared-library option. 
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Locating jnexus.jar</h3>
<p>
This is easier: just add the the full pathname to jnexus.jar to the
classpath when starting java. 
</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
A unix example shell script:
<pre>
#!/sbin/sh
java -classpath /usr/lib/classes.zip:../jnexus.jar:. \
 -Dneutron.nexus.JNEXUSLIB=../bin/du40/libjnexus.so TestJapi
 </pre>
A Windows 32 example batch file:
<pre>
set JL=-Dneutron.nexus.JNEXUSLIB=..\jnexus\bin\win32\jnexus.dll
java -classpath C:\jdk1.1.5\lib\classes.zip;..\jnexus.jar;. %JL% TestJapi
</pre>
</p>

<h2><a name="prog">Programming</a> with the NeXus API for Java.</h2>
<p>
The NeXus C-API is good enough but for Java a few adaptions of the API
have been made in order to match the API better to the idioms used by
Java programmers. In order to understand the Java -API it is useful to
study the NeXus C-API because many methods work in the same way as
their C equivalents. A full API documentation is available in Java
documentation format. For full reference look especially at:
<ul>
<li>The interface <a
href="apidoc/neutron.nexus.NeXusFileInterface.html">NeXusFileInterface
</a> first. It gives an uncluttered view of the API.
<li>The implementation <a
href="apidoc/neutron.nexus.NexusFile.html">NexusFile</a> which gives more
details about constructors and constants. However this documentation
is interspersed with information about native methods which should not
be called by an application programmer as they are not part of the
standard and might change in future. 
</ul> 
Some more general explanation will be given below.
</p>
<h3>General Things</h3>
<p>
See the following code example for opening a file, opening a vGroup
and closing the file again in order to get a feeling for the API.
<pre>
     try{
           NexusFile nf = new NexusFile(filename,
                    NexusFile.NXACC_READ);
           nf.opengroup("entry1","NXentry");
           nf.finalize();
     }catch(NexusException ne) {
         // oh shit! something was wrong!
     }
</pre>
Some notes on this little example:
<ul>
<li>Each NeXus file is represented by a NexusFile object which is
created through the constructor.
<li>The NexusFile object takes care of all file handles for you. So
there is no need to pass in a handle anymore to each method as in
the C language API. 
<li>All error handling is done through the Java exception handling
mechanism. This saves all the code checking return values in the C
language API. Most API functions return void. 
<li>Closing files is tricky. The Java garbage collector is supposed to
call the finalize method for each object it decides to delete. In
order to enable this mechanism, the NXclose function was replaced by
the finalize method. In practice it seems not to be guranteed that the 
garbage collector calls the finalize method. It is safer to call
finalize yourself in order to properly close a file. Multiple calls to
the finalize method for the same object are safe and do no harm.  
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Data Writing and Reading</h3>
<p>
Again a code sample which shows how this looks like:
<pre>
       int idata[][] = new idata[10][20];
       int iDim[] = new int[2];

        // put some data into iData.......

        // write iData
        iDim[0] = 10;
        iDim[1] = 20;
        nf.makedata("idata",NexusFile.NX_INT32,2,iDim);
        nf.opendata("idata");
	nf.putdata(idata);

        // read idata
        nf.getdata(idata);
</pre>
The dataset is created as usual with makedata and opened with
putdata. The trick is in putdata. Java is meant to be type safe. One
would think then that a putdata method would be required for each Java
data type. In order to avoid this the data to write is passed into
putdata as type Object. Then the API proceeds to analyze this object
through the Java introspection API and convert the data to a byte
stream for writing through the native method call. This is an elegant
solution with one drawback: An array is needed at all times. Even if
only a single data value is written (or read) an array of length one
and an appropriate type is the required argument.    
</p>
<p>
Another issue are strings. Strings are first class objects in
Java. HDF (and NeXus) sees them as dumb arrays of bytes. Thus strings
have to be converted to and from bytes when reading string data. See a
writing example:
<pre>
        String ame = "Alle meine Entchen";
	nf.makedata("string_data",NexusFile.NX_CHAR,1,
                           ame.length()+2);
        nf.opendata("string_data");
        nf.putdata(ame.getBytes());
</pre> 
And reading:
<pre>
        byte bData[] = new byte[132];
        nf.opendata("string_data");
        nf.getdata(bData);
        String string_data = new String(bData);
</pre>
The aforementioned holds for all strings written as SDS content or as
an attribute. SDS or vGroup names do not need this treatment. 
</p>
<h3>Inquiry Routines</h3>
<p>
Let us compare the C-API and Java-API signatures of the getinfo
routine or method:
<pre>
      /* C -API */
      NXstatus NXgetinfo(NXhandle handle, int *rank, int iDim[], 
                         int *datatype);
      // Java 
      void getinfo(int iDim[], int args[]);
</pre>
The problem is that Java passes arguments only by value, which means
they cannot be modified by the method. Only array arguments can be
modified. Thus args in the getinfo method holds the rank and datatype
information passed in separate items in the C-API version. For
resolving which one is which consult a debugger or the API-reference.  
</p>
<p>
The attribute and vGroup search routines have been simplified using
Hashtables. The Hastable returned by <b>groupdir()</b> holds the name
of the item as a key and the classname or the string SDS as ths stored
object for the key. Thus the code for a vGroup search looks like this:
<pre>
         nf.opengroup(group,nxclass);
         h = nf.groupdir();
         e = h.keys();
         System.out.println("Found in vGroup entry:");
         while(e.hasMoreElements())
	 {
            vname = (String)e.nextElement();
            vclass = (String)h.get(vname);
            System.out.println("     Item: " + vname + " class: " + vclass);
         }
</pre>
For an attribute search both at global or SDS level the returned
Hashtable will hold the name as the key and a little class holding the
type and size information as value. Thus an attribute search looks
like this in the Java-API:
<pre>
         Hashtable h = nf.attrdir();
         Enumeration e = h.keys();
         while(e.hasMoreElements())
	 {
           attname = (String)e.nextElement();
           atten = (AttributeEntry)h.get(attname);
           System.out.println("Found global attribute: " + attname +
             " type: "+ atten.type + " ,length: " + atten.length); 
         }
</pre>   
</p>
<p>
For more information about the usage of the API routines see the
reference or the NeXus C-API reference pages. Another good source of
information is the source code of the  <a href="test/TestJapi.java">test
program </a> which exercises each API routine. 
</p>

<h2><a name="lim">Limitations</a></h2>
<p>
These are a couple of known problems which you might run into:
<dl>
<DT>Memory
<DD>As the Java API for NeXus has to convert between native and Java
number types a copy of the data must be made in the process. This
means that if you want to read or write 20MB of data your memory requirement
will be 40MB! This can be reduced by using getslab/putslab for data
transfers. 
<DT>Java.lang.OutOfMemoryException
<DD>By default the Java runtime has a ceiling of 16MB of memory
use. This ceiling can be increased through the -mxXXm option to the
Java runtime. An example: java -mx32m ..... starts the Java runtime
with a memory ceiling of 32MB.
<DT>DigitalUnix4.0D and LZW compression
<DD>An error occurs in the HDF library when trying to compress a
dataset with COMP_CODE_LZW. This works just fine on other platforms
and also when using the NeXus C language API. The reason for this is
still an area for research.
<DT>Maximum 8192 files open.
<DD>The NeXus API for Java has a fixed buffer for file handles which
allows only 8192 NeXus files to be open at the same time.  If you ever
hit this limit, increase the MAXHANDLE define in native/handle.h and
recompile everything. 
</dl>
</p>
<h2><a name="comp">Compiling</a> the Java API for NeXus</h2> 
<p>
You will need <li>a complete copy of the latest 
 <a href="http://sutekh.nd.rl.ac.uk/NAPI"> NAPI sources</a> (including jnexus
sources). See other <a href="#install">requirements</a> under
 installation above. 
</p>
<p>
For Windows32 a Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project file is supplied in
the jnexus/jnexus directory. Use this project file. You will need to
adapt the directory settings under Tools/Options/Directories for both
include and library directories  in order to reflect the placement of
the HDF libraries and the jnexus source code in your directory
hierarchy. Hitting F7 after that should build the shared
library. Hint: Only a release build is possible with the HDF library
binaries. If a debug build is needed you have to recompile the HDF
libraries yourself. For a recompilation of the Java classes use the
compilejava batch file in the jnexus main directory.
</p>
<p>
For DigitalUnix4.0D and Redhat Linux 6.2 Makefiles are provided
(Makefile and Make.tux repectively). For these systems everything can
be build with make du40 of make -f make.tux respectively.  
If the Makefiles do not work edit the
directory paths in the configuration section to match your
installation. If you wish to compile on another unix system, create a
copy of one of the above mentioned Makefiles and edit the
configuration section in your copy to match your installation of java
and the HDF libraries. If you succeed in building the NeXus API for
Java on a new system, please put back modified sources into the CVS
repository and make your Makefile and the compiled shared library
available to the NAPI team in order to provide a new binary
distribution.
