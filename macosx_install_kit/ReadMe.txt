NeXus is a common data format for neutron, x-ray, and muon science. It is being developed as an international standard by scientists and programmers representing major scientific facilities in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America in order to facilitate greater cooperation in the analysis and visualization of neutron, x-ray, and muon data.

This package provides libraries for interacting with NeXus files, with bindings for C, C++, Fortran, Python, Java and IDL.
