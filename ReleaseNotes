Changes in Version 1.3.0
========================

- added NXcompress to both the C- and F77 API. Compression works only with
  Release 3 of the HDF-4.1 libraries or better. Note: on my DigitalUnix 4.0D
  installation I had to link against the jpeg library supplied with HDF 
  directly due to a conflict with a system shared library. Replace -ljpeg
  by $HDFROOT/lib/libjpeg.a.

Changes in Version 1.2.1
========================

- Released NeXus API under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License.

Changes in Version 1.2.0
========================

- NXGETCHARDATA, NXGETCHARATTR, NXPUTCHARDATA and NXPUTCHARATTR added 
  to Fortran 77 interface to correct problems with handling character data 
  and attributes.

- Reversed dimension order and adjusted starting indices in NXGETSLAB 
  and NXPUTSLAB in Fortran 77 interface for improved compatibility with the 
  C interface.

- All SDSes now created with the DFTAG_NDG tag, rather than DFTAG_SDG,
  which is now deprecated by HDF.

- Expanded number of NeXus routines and data types checked by the test 
  programs "napi_test.c", "napif_test.f" and "NXtest.f90". 
  
- Excluded null terminator from string length check in REPLACE_STRING to
  prevent error messages when the string is exactly the right length.

- Added definitions of NX_MAXRANK (max. no. of dataset dimensions = 32) to 
  and NX_MAXNAMELEN (max. length of dataset name = 64) to header files.

- Made NXIReportError globally visible

- Improved determination of local time zone when writing the global file
  attribute "file_time"

- Added option to NXbrowse.f90 to allow display of individual array elements
  of the specified index

- Added check for __ABSOFT macro in "napi.h" to make compatible with 
  Absoft Pro Fortran for Linux

- Add __stdcall definition to C prototypes under WIN32 so they can link 
  to FORTRAN 

Changes in Version 1.1.0
========================

- First appearance of the Fortran 90 API.

- Added reading and writing of non-character attributes to the Fortran 77 
  interface

- Corrected problems with linking groups by making NXgetgroupID 
  and NXmakelink use the HDF tag/ref pair in NXlink structures.

- Added VMS build file MAKE_VMS.COM.

- Added NEXUS_VERSION CHARACTER constant to NAPIF.INC, with value as defined 
  in napi.h

- Made the Fortran 77 interface treat both NX_UINT8 and NX_CHAR as strings, for
  consistency with the C implementation and also for backward compatability 
  reasons.

- Fixed memory leak on Fortran 77 side on NXclose

- NXdict added to the normal distribution

- Added casts to HDF API calling parameters to eliminate type-mismatch
  compiler warnings.

- Modified time creation functions to handle non-working gmtime()
  function on VMS 6.2. 


Changes in Version 1.0.0
========================

- Reversed array dimensions on going from C to FORTRAN, so that the 
  "fastest varying index" is kept consistent

- Incorporated fixes suggested by Markus Zolliker (markus.zolliker@psi.ch)
  for the following problems with the FORTRAN interface:

  (1) NXopen ends with a "Segmentation fault" if the file is not HDF.
  (2) NXgetentry gives an error message when NAME and CLASS are not
    initialised to blank.

- Changed "data" from char* to void* in NXgetattr

- Changed value for NXACC_CREATE to be DFACC_CREATE rather than DFACC_ALL
  in NAPIF.INC for consistency with C interface

- Added the following global attributes
  NeXus_version - updated whenever a file is opened "read/write", so it
                  will always contain the latest version of the interface
                  the file was written with
  file_name     - set on file creation, then left unchanged
  file_time     - set on file creation, then left unchanged
